# Open_Weather_Display
## Description
This is a simple weather API retrieval website that allows users to search a specific city and discover its weather conditions. Recently searched cities are outputted below the search bar as buttons. These buttons are clickable and can display weather condition data for the city named on their label.

## Installation
Download the repository on your machine and run on a live server. 

**NOTE:** A legitimate API key for the OpenWeatherMap API is required and one will not be provided by the author. If a legitimate API key is not used, OpenWeatherMap API retrieval is impossible. 

Follow sign-in instructions from the OpenWeatherMap website to activate an API key: https://openweathermap.org/

## Use
Follow the link below the display the website:
https://rhonvyramos.github.io/Open_Weather_Display/

**NOTE:** this will only show the initial display. This GitHub page will not work unless your own, cloned repository has been assigned a legitimate API key.

## Screenshot
Below is how the web page will initially appear to the user. Display elements will change accordingly should the user successfully search for city weather conditions.
